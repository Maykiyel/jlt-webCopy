# Structure Enforcement Checklist

Use this checklist for any implementation, refactor, or review touching architecture and folder boundaries.

## 1. Intake and Scope Mapping

1. List touched files.
2. Tag each as shared, feature, or app layer.
3. Identify whether any files are misplaced based on layer intent.
4. Confirm whether behavior changes are expected.

## 2. Folder Placement

1. Domain logic lives in src/features/<feature> unless truly shared.
2. Shared code is placed only in shared folders (components, hooks, lib, stores, types, utils).
3. App composition remains in src/app.
4. Page/container files focus on orchestration; reusable logic is extracted.

## 3. Feature Shape

1. Feature folder includes only required subfolders (api, assets, components, hooks, stores, types, utils).
2. No unnecessary empty feature subfolders are introduced.
3. Types and utils remain close to the feature unless broadly reused.

## 4. API Placement

1. Feature-specific API declarations live in src/features/<feature>/api by default.
2. Shared API modules are used only when contracts are truly cross-feature.
3. API placement choice is documented when exceptions are made.

## 5. Import Boundaries

1. Shared modules do not import from features or app.
2. Features do not import from sibling features unless explicitly approved.
3. App may import from shared and features.
4. Direct imports are preferred over barrel-file indirection.
5. Dependency direction remains Shared -> Features -> App.

## 6. ESLint Architecture Rules

1. import/no-restricted-paths zones reflect cross-feature restrictions.
2. import/no-restricted-paths zones reflect unidirectional flow restrictions.
3. Rules are scoped to avoid blocking valid existing imports unintentionally.

## 7. Safety and Verification

1. Patch size remains minimal and avoids unrelated format churn.
2. Existing behavior is preserved unless change is explicitly requested.
3. Validation commands are run according to scope.

## 8. Evidence Recording

1. Mark each section as pass or fail.
2. Record one concrete reason for each fail item.
3. Record exact command evidence for validation gates.
4. If skipping a required gate, record rationale and risk.
