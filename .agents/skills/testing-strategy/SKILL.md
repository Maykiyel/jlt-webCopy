# Testing Strategy

## Purpose

Apply a repeatable testing workflow that prioritizes confidence in real behavior through integration and end-to-end coverage, while still using unit tests where they provide strong value.

## Use This Skill When

- Adding a new feature and defining test coverage.
- Fixing a bug and adding regression tests.
- Refactoring existing code with behavior-preserving checks.
- Improving confidence in user flows across route, API, and UI boundaries.
- Deciding whether to use unit, integration, or e2e for a given risk.

## Standards Library

Use these references as the source of truth while executing this skill.

1. Testing principles and tooling guidance: [testing guidelines](./references/testing-guidelines.md)
2. Step-by-step execution and validation: [testing checklist](./references/testing-checklist.md)
3. Existing repository test baseline: `tests/quotations/`

## Workflow

1. Define the risk first: what user behavior could fail?
2. Select the lowest-cost test level that still proves the behavior; default to integration before unit-only coverage.
3. Add unit tests for isolated complex logic and shared utilities.
4. Add integration tests for feature flows and component-to-component/API interaction.
5. Add e2e tests for critical journeys that must work in production-like conditions.
6. Use API mocking through MSW when backend contracts are unavailable or when deterministic test control is required.
7. Run targeted tests first, then broader test suites.
8. Report what is covered, what remains untested, and why.

## Operating Modes

1. Quick pass: add focused regression tests for a localized change.
2. Standard pass: add or update integration coverage plus targeted unit tests.
3. Strict pass: include critical e2e coverage and full validation gates.

## Non-Negotiables

- Prefer behavior-focused assertions over implementation-detail assertions.
- Prioritize integration and e2e coverage for user-critical flows.
- Keep unit tests for reusable logic, shared functions, and hard-to-reason transformations.
- Avoid brittle tests that depend on internal state shape when UI behavior is the real contract.
- Keep tests deterministic and isolated from external network flakiness.
