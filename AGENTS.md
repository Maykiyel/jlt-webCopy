# JLT Agent Operating Guide

This `AGENTS.md` is intentionally lightweight and delegates detailed guidance to the `.agents/` directory.

## Source of Truth

For architecture, standards, and implementation workflows, **always consult `.agents/` first**.

- Global instructions: `.agents/copilot-instructions.md`
- Skill playbooks: `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md`

If any content in this file appears to overlap with `.agents/` skill docs, treat the `.agents/` docs as the authoritative and more detailed source.

## Required Agent Workflow

Before making code changes:

1. Read this file.
2. Read `.agents/copilot-instructions.md`.
3. Select and apply the relevant skill(s) from `.agents/skills/` based on the task.
4. Follow the selected skill workflow exactly (including validation/check steps).

## Baseline Standards (Always Enforced)

Even when no single skill is an exact match, agents must still enforce these baseline rules:

1. Keep changes minimal, targeted, and behavior-safe unless behavior changes are explicitly requested.
2. Preserve feature-first architecture and unidirectional dependency flow (`Shared -> Features -> App`).
3. Prefer existing utilities/components over duplication.
4. Keep business/domain logic inside `src/features` unless it is truly shared.
5. Run appropriate validation for touched code (lint, typecheck, tests, or skill-recommended checks).
6. Default to optimistic UI for user-triggered mutations (create/update/delete) with explicit rollback/error recovery, unless a safer non-optimistic flow is required by business or security constraints.
7. When fixing bugs or adding features, prefer global/centralized remediation (shared utility, hook, store, API policy, or boundary rule) over isolated local patches when the same issue can appear in multiple surfaces.

## Skill Routing Expectations

Use `.agents/skills/` as the primary routing mechanism:

- `project-structure` for module boundaries, import direction, and folder ownership.
- `performance-optimization` for rerenders, bundle/chunking, loading, and Web Vitals.
- `error-handling` for resilient API/runtime error flows and boundaries.
- `security-auth` for authentication, authorization, token handling, and OWASP-sensitive changes.
- `testing-strategy` for integration/e2e coverage and regression prevention.
- Apply optimistic-update rules across these skills by default for mutation flows (including rollback handling, cache consistency, and deterministic testing).

If multiple concerns apply, combine the minimum necessary set of skills and execute them in a clear sequence.

## Final Check

Do not finalize work until you have confirmed:

- Relevant `.agents` skill instructions were actually applied.
- Changed code aligns with architecture and state-management standards in `.agents` docs.
- Validation has been run and results are reported clearly.
- Optimistic mutation behavior is implemented/validated (or explicitly documented as intentionally not used).
- The fix was evaluated for global applicability and centralized when practical.
- Agent output clearly documents optimistic-decision rationale and global-remediation rationale for applicable changes.
